# Rental-Price-Analysis
This program takes data from a CSV file which contains information about rental properties in a particular city. The data includes the address, neighborhood, rent in 2020, and rent in 2021. Using all that data this program creats a text file called report.txt which provides a full analysis about all the rental properties in the city.

The analysis includes the following:

  - Average Rent
  - Highest Rent (Price & Address)
  - Lowest Rent (Price & Address)
  - Average Rent Change from previous year
  - Highest Rent Change (Price & Address)
  - Lowest Rent Change (Price & Address)
  - Least Affordable Neighborhood (Place & Average Rent)
  - Most Affordable Neighborhood (Place & Average Rent)
  - Average Rent Change per Neighborhood


I have included a sample CSV file, along with the respective report.txt file that was generated by the program.
